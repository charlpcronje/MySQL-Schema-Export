# Code Explained

## Overview
The application automates the process of generating documentation for a MySQL database schema. It analyzes the structure of the database, including its tables, columns, relationships, stored procedures, and views. The result is a Markdown file that offers a clear, readable overview of the database's schema, which can be invaluable for database administrators, developers, and analysts.

## Functionality Breakdown

1. **Database Connection Setup**
- The application starts by checking if the `.env` file exists, which contains necessary database connection details (host, user, password, database name).
- If the `.env` file is not found, it prompts the user to enter these details, which it then saves for future use.

1. **Database Connection**
- Utilizing the credentials from the `.env` file, the application establishes a connection to the MySQL database.

1. **Data Extraction**
- The application performs SQL queries to extract detailed information about:
- **Tables and Columns**: Retrieves names of tables, their columns, primary key status, and relationships (foreign keys) between tables.
- **Stored Procedures**: Fetches names of all stored procedures in the database.
- **Views**: Obtains information about database views.

1. **Data Analysis and Categorization**
- **Stored Procedures**: Analyzes the names of stored procedures and categorizes them based on common operations (like Create/Add, Delete/Remove, Update/Edit, etc.). This analysis helps in understanding the purpose and functionality of each procedure.

1. **Markdown Documentation Generation**
- The application then writes this extracted and analyzed data to a Markdown file named "MySQL Database Schema.md".
- It formats the information for readability and clarity, using Markdown syntax. This includes:
  - A section detailing the database tables, their columns, and relationships, including visual symbols to represent different types of relationships (one-to-one, one-to-many, etc.).
  - A categorized list of stored procedures with inferred descriptions based on their names.
  - Details of the database views.

1. **Cleanup**
- After all operations are complete, the application closes the database connection and cursor, ensuring a clean and safe exit.

## Output
The final output is a comprehensive Markdown document titled "MySQL Database Schema.md". This document serves as a detailed schema guide, allowing for easy understanding and reference to the database's structure, procedures, and views.

## Use Case
This tool is particularly useful in scenarios where a database's structure needs to be documented for technical documentation, onboarding new team members, auditing, or keeping a record of the database schema for future reference. It automates what would otherwise be a time-consuming and error-prone manual process.

In summary, the application streamlines the process of documenting a MySQL database's schema, making the data easily accessible and understandable, thereby enhancing database management and knowledge sharing.

```python
  table, column, is_primary, ref_table, ref_column, is_unique, ref_is_unique = row
```
- **Unpack Row Data**:
- Extracts table, column, and various flags (primary, unique, etc.) from each row.

```python

```
- **Writing Stored Procedures**:
- The function writes categorized stored procedures, along with descriptions and categories, to the file.

I'll continue with `procedure_analysis.py` and `schema_extraction.py` in the next response. Let me know if you want me to proceed.

Continuing with the detailed explanations:

### `procedure_analysis.py`

```python
def categorize_and_describe_stored_procedures(proc_list):
```
- **Function Definition**:
- Defines a function `categorize_and_describe_stored_procedures` which takes a list of stored procedure names (`proc_list`) and categorizes them based on predefined keywords.

```python
  operation_keywords = {
    "Create/Add": ["add", "save", "create", "insert", "doInsert", "clone"],
    "Delete/Remove": ["delete", "remove", "quickDelete", "doRemove"],
    "Link/Join": ["link", "join", "doLink", "doJoin"],
    "Update/Edit": ["update", "edit", "set", "doMark"],
    "Get/Generate": ["get", "generate", "getNext"]
  }
```
- **Keyword Mapping**:
- A dictionary `operation_keywords` is defined, mapping categories (like "Create/Add", "Delete/Remove") to lists of keywords. These keywords are used to infer the purpose of each stored procedure based on its name.

```python
  categorized_procs = {
    "Create/Add": [],
    "Delete/Remove": [],
    "Link/Join": [],
    "Update/Edit": [],
    "Get/Generate": [],
    "Miscellaneous": []
  }
```
- **Categorized Procedures Initialization**:
- Initializes a dictionary `categorized_procs` with the same categories as keys and empty lists as values. This dictionary will store the procedures categorized under each type.

```python
  for proc in proc_list:
    categorized = False
    for category, keywords in operation_keywords.items():
      if any(keyword.lower() in proc.lower() for keyword in keywords):
          categorized_procs[category].append(proc)
          categorized = True
          break
    if not categorized:
      categorized_procs["Miscellaneous"].append(proc)
```
- **Categorization Logic**:
- Iterates through each procedure in `proc_list`.
- For each procedure, it checks against each category's keywords. If a keyword matches (ignoring case), the procedure is added to the respective category in `categorized_procs`.
- If no keywords match, the procedure is added to "Miscellaneous".

```python
  return categorized_procs
```
- **Return Result**:
- Returns the `categorized_procs` dictionary containing stored procedures categorized by their inferred functionality.

### `schema_extraction.py`

```python
import os
```
- **Import**:
- Imports the `os` module for interacting with the operating system, particularly for fetching environment variables.

```python
def get_table_column_data(cursor):
```
- **Function Definition**:
- Defines a function `get_table_column_data` which uses a database cursor (`cursor`) to execute a query and fetch data about tables and their columns.

```python
    query = """
    SELECT 
        t.table_name, 
        c.column_name, 
        IF(k.column_name IS NOT NULL, 1, 0) AS is_primary,
        k.referenced_table_name,
        k.referenced_column_name,
        (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.table_constraints tc
         JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage kcu ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name
         WHERE tc.table_schema = c.table_schema AND tc.table_name = c.table_name AND tc.constraint_type = 'UNIQUE'
         AND kcu.column_name = c.column_name) AS is_unique,
        (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.table_constraints tc
         JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage kcu ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name
         WHERE tc.table_schema = k.referenced_table_schema AND tc.table_name = k.referenced_table_name AND tc.constraint_type = 'UNIQUE'
         AND kcu.column_name = k.referenced_column_name) AS ref_is_unique
    FROM 
        information_schema.tables t
        JOIN information_schema.columns c ON t.table_schema = c.table_schema AND t.table_name = c.table_name
        LEFT JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage k ON c.table_schema = k.table_schema 
            AND c.table_name = k.table_name 
            AND c.column_name = k.column_name 
            AND k.referenced_table_schema IS NOT NULL
    WHERE 
        t.table_schema = %s
    ORDER BY 
        t.table_name, 
        c.ordinal_position
    """
```
- **SQL Query**:
  - This complex SQL query retrieves detailed information about each column in every table within a specified database schema. Let's break down the query:

  - `SELECT` clause: Selects various column attributes from the `information_schema` tables.
  - `t.table_name, c.column_name`: Fetches the table name and column name.
  - `IF(k.column_name IS NOT NULL, 1, 0) AS is_primary`: Checks if the column is a primary key.
  - `k.referenced_table_name, k.referenced_column_name`: Gets the referenced table and column for foreign key relationships.
  - The two subqueries with `COUNT(*)` determine if a column is unique within its table and if the referenced column in a foreign key relationship is unique.
  - The `FROM` and `JOIN` clauses combine data from tables, columns, and key usage information.
  - `WHERE t.table_schema = %s`: Filters data for the specified database schema.
  - `ORDER BY t.table_name, c.ordinal_position`: Orders the results by table name and column position.

```python
  cursor.execute(query, (os.getenv("DB_DATABASE"),))
```
- **Executing Query**:
- Executes the SQL query using the provided cursor and the database name fetched from the environment variables.

```python
  return cursor.fetchall()
```
- **Return Query Result**:
- Returns all the rows fetched by the executed query, providing detailed information about each column in every table.

```python
def get_stored_procedures(cursor):
```
- **Function Definition**:
- Defines a function `get_stored_procedures` to retrieve the names of all stored procedures in the database.

```python
  cursor.execute("""
    SELECT ROUTINE_NAME
    FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.ROUTINES
    WHERE ROUTINE_SCHEMA = %s AND ROUTINE_TYPE = 'PROCEDURE';
  """, (os.getenv("DB_DATABASE"),))
```
- **Executing Stored Procedure Query**:
- Executes a SQL query to fetch the names of all stored procedures in the specified database schema.

```python
  return [row[0] for row in cursor.fetchall()]
```
- **Return Procedure Names**:
- Fetches all the rows returned by the query and extracts the first element of each row (the stored procedure name), returning a list of these names.

Continuing with the explanations for the remaining files:

### `.env`
This is a configuration file, not a Python script, but it's crucial for the application's configuration. It contains environment variables which are key-value pairs. In your application, it's used to store database connection details and possibly other settings.

```env
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=
DB_DATABASE=ig_db

LAYOUT=TXT
```
- **Environment Variables**:
- `DB_HOST`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_DATABASE`: These are the credentials and host details for connecting to the MySQL database. They are used by the `database_connection.py` script.
- `LAYOUT`: This could be an additional setting (not directly referenced in the provided Python files), perhaps specifying the format or layout for some output or operation.

### `main.py`
This is the main entry point of your application. It orchestrates the database schema extraction, analysis, and documentation by calling functions from the other modules.

```python
from database_connection import connect_to_db
from env_file_handler import prompt_for_db_details, write_env_file
from schema_extraction import get_table_column_data, get_stored_procedures
from procedure_analysis import categorize_and_describe_stored_procedures
from markdown_writer import write_table_data_to_markdown, write_stored_procedures_to_markdown
from views_analysis import get_views, write_views_to_markdown
import os
```
- **Imports**: These lines import various functions from the other modules in your application, along with the `os` module.

```python
if not os.path.isfile('.env'):
    prompt_for_db_details()
```
- **Environment File Check**: If the `.env` file does not exist, the script calls `prompt_for_db_details` to create one.

```python
conn = connect_to_db()
cursor = conn.cursor()
```
- **Database Connection**: Establishes a database connection and creates a cursor for executing SQL queries.

```python
try:
```
- **Try Block**: Starts a block for exception handling.

```python
  data = get_table_column_data(cursor)
  filename = 'MySQL Database Schema.md'
```
- **Get Table Data**: Fetches the schema data for tables and sets the filename for the output Markdown file.

```python
  write_table_data_to_markdown(data, filename)
```
- **Write Table Data to Markdown**: Writes the table schema data to the Markdown file.

```python
  proc_list = get_stored_procedures(cursor)
  categorized_procs = categorize_and_describe_stored_procedures(proc_list)
  write_stored_procedures_to_markdown(categorized_procs, filename)
```
- **Stored Procedure Analysis**: Retrieves stored procedures, categorizes them, and writes this information to the Markdown file.

```python
  view_data = get_views(cursor)
  write_views_to_markdown(view_data, filename)
```
- **View Analysis**: Retrieves view data and writes it to the Markdown file.

```python
finally:
  cursor.close()
  conn.close()
  print("Database connection closed.")
```
- **Cleanup**: Closes the database connection and cursor, and prints a message indicating closure.
